# Homework 6: Good README Generator

## Description
Created a Read Me Generator that calls GitHub's API data to populate the user's avatar and username and prompts the user in the command line a series of questions to compile their project README.md.

To use this application, open the index.js and in the command line enter:

    npm i  // to install all dependencies
    node .\index.js

The user will then be prompted for the following information: 

* GitHub username
* Github email
* Project title
* Description
* Installation
* Usage
* License
* Contributing
* Tests

## Technologies
* node.js
* axios NPM 
* inquierer NPM 
* fs NPM
* require NPM 

## Challenges
Some of the challenges in creating this project were using ES6 and Node.js, working with async and await, and keeping track of the location of the data.
